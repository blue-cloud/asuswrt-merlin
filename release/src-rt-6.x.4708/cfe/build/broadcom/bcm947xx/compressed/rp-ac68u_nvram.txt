#  For 4707/8/9 - Required to set the DDR PHY clock correctly *before*
#  the boot code is copied to DDR. Since the NVRAM parsing is done
#  after the execution is passed to DDR, the DDR PHY clock must be
#  reconfigured from its default of 333MHz. This parameter is stored
#  in a fixed location in the CFE space, the bootloader can read it
#  while XIP processing is still active. This is a limitation of the
#  way the DDR PHY clock reconfiguration occurs on 4708x parts.

# et0mcdport is which MDC/MDIO port is used to connect to the PHY/Switch chip. Only 4703/4704 has two MIIs, so this
# parameter is nearly always "0".
et0mdcport=0

# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# Up until 9/2009 MAC addresses had the format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  YY   |  YY   |
# where YYYY is the serial number and XX was assigned per interface and per boardtype. The macmid covered bits 31:16
# which includes the 0x4C octet from the OUI and the XX value. That allowed 65536 serial numbers for each board type
# but only 256 distinct interface/ boardtype combos.
#
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from that 8/16 split to a 12/12 split, so the new macmid will be
# based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# An old-style macmid:
#   BCM94716nr2   0x4C04
# a new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so nvram text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}
# instead of the previous way:

# Ethernet switch config (vlan0:LAN, vlan1:WAN)
# WAN is on port 0, LAN is on ports 1-4. Port 5 is the MII interface to the external switch or switch core.
# It MUST be present on all VLANs. The "*" means to enable this group for CFE use. Only one VLAN can have this,
# typically the LAN. 5325E/F and all internal switch cores use "5" for the MII port. 5395, 5397, and 53115 all use
# "8" for the MII/GMII/RGMII port number.

# The WAN port is almost always on an Ethernet port so use the normal config. If the WAN
# port is not an Ethernet port, then this parameter must be changed accordingly.
# NOTE: If WAN packets are vlan tagged, then must use "vlan2" in place of "et0".
#       For the default case of no WAN vlan tags, then must use "et0".
# NOTE: If the board does not have a WAN port then must use "wandevs=".
